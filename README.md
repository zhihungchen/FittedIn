## 📖 Overview

Most health applications are **data-driven** — they count steps, calories, or workouts — but often fail to create a **sense of community**. As a result, users start with enthusiasm but quickly lose motivation.

**FittedIn** aims to change this by reimagining health and wellness tracking as a **social, networking-style experience**, inspired by LinkedIn. The platform encourages **connections, accountability, and shared progress**, turning isolated health efforts into **collaborative journeys**.

## 🧪 Testing

### API Testing
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Registration
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"displayName":"John Doe","email":"john@example.com","password":"Password123"}'

# Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"john@example.com","password":"Password123"}'
```

### Database Testing
```bash
# Test pgAdmin setup
./test-pgadmin.sh

# Direct database access
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d fittedin_dev
```

### Database Seeding
```bash
# Seed database with fake data (50 users, goals, posts, connections, etc.)
cd backend
npm run db:seed:faker

# Clear existing data and seed fresh data
npm run db:seed:clear

# Custom amounts
SEED_NUM_USERS=100 SEED_NUM_POSTS=300 npm run db:seed:faker
```

**Note:** All seeded users have password: `Password123!`
