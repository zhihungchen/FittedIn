## Overview

Most health applications are **data-driven** — they count steps, calories, or workouts — but often fail to create a **sense of community**. As a result, users start with enthusiasm but quickly lose motivation.

**FittedIn** aims to change this by reimagining health and wellness tracking as a **social, networking-style experience**, inspired by LinkedIn. The platform encourages **connections, accountability, and shared progress**, turning isolated health efforts into **collaborative journeys**.

## Tech Stack & Architecture

### **Backend Architecture**
- **Runtime**: Node.js v20+ with Express.js framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ with Sequelize ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT-based stateless auth with bcrypt password hashing (10 salt rounds)
- **Architecture Pattern**: Three-tier architecture (Presentation → Application → Data Layer)
- **API Design**: RESTful API with proper HTTP methods and status codes
- **Code Organization**: MVC pattern with separation of concerns (Controllers, Services, Models, Middleware)

### **Infrastructure & DevOps**
- **Cloud Platform**: AWS Cloud Computing Services
- **Reverse Proxy**: Nginx with SSL/TLS termination and HTTP/2 support
- **Process Management**: PM2 with cluster mode support, auto-restart, graceful shutdown, and log rotation
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose for local development environment
- **Auto-Scaling**: EC2 Auto Scaling Groups configured (production-ready)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing and deployment (configurable)

### **Security Features**
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with configurable expiration (7 days default)
- **Password Security**: bcrypt hashing with 10 salt rounds
- **API Protection**: Rate limiting (configurable per environment), Helmet.js security headers
- **Input Validation**: Express-validator for comprehensive request validation
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries via Sequelize ORM
- **HTTPS**: SSL/TLS encryption in production using Let's Encrypt
- **CORS**: Configurable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing policies

### **Database Design**
- **ORM**: Sequelize with automated migrations and seeders
- **Relationships**: Complex relational model (Users, Profiles, Goals, Connections, Activities, Posts, Notifications)
- **Performance**: Strategic database indexing on frequently queried columns
- **Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints, cascade deletes, and transaction support
- **Seeding**: Faker.js integration for generating realistic test data at scale


### **Key Technical Decisions**
- **No Frontend Framework**: Vanilla JavaScript to demonstrate core web fundamentals and reduce bundle size
- **PostgreSQL over MongoDB**: Relational data with complex joins, ACID compliance, and better query performance
- **Monorepo Structure**: Separated frontend/backend directories for independent deployment and scaling
- **PM2 over Docker in Production**: Better resource control and monitoring on EC2 instances
- **Nginx Reverse Proxy**: Separation of static assets and API routing for improved scalability and caching

## Current Features

### Authentication System
- **Secure Registration**: JWT-based user registration with password validation
- **Login System**: Email/password authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- **Protected Routes**: JWT middleware for securing API endpoints
- **User Profiles**: Comprehensive user profile management with privacy settings

### Goal Management
- **Goal Tracking**: Set and monitor personal wellness goals
- **Progress Monitoring**: Track current progress vs target values
- **Goal Categories**: Weight loss, muscle gain, cardio, nutrition, etc.
- **Milestone System**: Break down goals into achievable milestones

### Database Management
- **pgAdmin Interface**: Web-based database management at `http://localhost:5050`
- **PostgreSQL**: Robust relational database with proper indexing
- **Migration System**: Automated database schema management
- **Database Seeding**: Generate fake data with Faker.js for testing and development
- **Auto-Accept Connections**: Seeded users automatically accept connection requests for better testing experience

## Testing

### API Testing
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Registration
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"displayName":"John Doe","email":"john@example.com","password":"Password123"}'

# Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"john@example.com","password":"Password123"}'
```

### Database Testing
```bash
# Test pgAdmin setup
./test-pgadmin.sh

# Direct database access
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d fittedin_dev
```

### Database Seeding
```bash
# Seed database with fake data (50 users, goals, posts, connections, etc.)
cd backend
npm run db:seed:faker

# Clear existing data and seed fresh data
npm run db:seed:clear

# Custom amounts
SEED_NUM_USERS=100 SEED_NUM_POSTS=300 npm run db:seed:faker
```

**Note:** All seeded users have password: `Password123!`
